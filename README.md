# Text Summarizer App

This repository contains a Python Streamlit application that implements a text summarizer. The app takes a text as input and generates a concise summary of the same. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to identify key information and condense the text into a shorter version.

## Features

- Automatic text summarization: Given a text, the app can automatically generate a summary that captures the main points of the document..
- Python library: The text summarization functionality is encapsulated in a Python library, allowing developers to integrate it into their own projects.

## Installation

To use the Text Summarizer App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/parishat19/Text-Summarizer-app
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd Text-Summarizer-app
   

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. Run the app:

   
   streamlit text.py
   

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with it using the browser interface. Input the text in the given field, and let the app produce output by pressing the button.

## Acknowledgments

- The text summarization algorithm used in this app is based on the research and techniques developed in the field of natural language processing.
- I could make this possible because of my mentors Kundeshwar Vijay Pundalik and Adresh Alagade
- The app was inspired by the need to efficiently extract key information from large volumes of text for various applications.
